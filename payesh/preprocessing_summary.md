# Preprocessing and Cleaning Notebook Summary

This notebook details the steps taken to preprocess and clean the water meter data for the years 1401, 1402, and 1403. The goal is to prepare the data for further analysis and modeling by handling missing values, inconsistent data points, and exploring the data characteristics.

## 1. Loading Data

The process begins by loading the raw data files for different years and potentially different data types (long format usage data and info data). These datasets are loaded into pandas DataFrames for manipulation.

- `df_long_1401`: Long format usage data for 1401 (saved as `long_usage1401.csv`).
- `df_long_1402`: Long format usage data for 1402 (saved as `long_usage1402.csv`).
- `df_long_1403`: Long format usage data for 1403 (saved as `long_usage1403.csv`).
- `df_info_1402`: Information data for 1402.
- `df_info_1403`: Information data for 1403.

## 2. Initial Data Exploration

Initial exploration is performed to understand the structure, content, and quality of the loaded data. This includes:

- Checking the dimensions of the DataFrames.
- Displaying the first few rows (`.head()`) to get a glimpse of the data (e.g., outputs showing `df_info_1402.head()`, `df_long_1403.head()`).
- Examining data types and non-null counts (`.info()`).
- Calculating summary statistics (`.describe()`) for numerical columns to identify potential issues like outliers or unusual distributions (e.g., outputs showing `.describe()` for various dataframes and columns).
- Identifying the number of missing values per column (`.isnull().sum()`) (e.g., output showing missing counts for 'Flow Rate (l/s)', 'Operating Hours (h)', etc.).

## 3. Data Cleaning and Transformation

Several cleaning and transformation steps are applied:

- **Column Renaming**: Columns are renamed for clarity or consistency, likely using a translation dictionary (as seen in the code `df_long_1403.rename(columns=column_translations,inplace=True)`).
- **Handling Negative Consumption**: Rows with negative values in the 'Consumption in Period (m³)' column are identified and removed from the info dataframes for 1402 and 1403, as negative consumption is physically impossible and indicates data errors (e.g., cells filtering for `< 0` consumption and creating `customers_to_drop`). Cleaned info dataframes (`df_info_clean_1402`, `df_info_clean_1403`) are created after dropping these customers.
- **Addressing Missing Values**: While specific imputation or dropping strategies for other missing values are not explicitly detailed in the provided context, the initial identification of missing values suggests this is a focus area.
- **Outlier Analysis**: Summary statistics and potentially visualizations (like box plots, although not explicitly shown in outputs) are used to understand the distribution and identify potential outliers in numerical columns like 'Operating Hours in Period (h)' and 'Average Flow Rate in Period (l/s)'. Detailed statistics for 'Operating Hours in Period (h)' were calculated (mean, median, skewness, kurtosis, quartiles).

## 4. Data Analysis and Visualization

Basic analysis and visualization are performed to gain insights into the data:

- **Correlation Analysis**: A correlation matrix is calculated and displayed to understand the relationships between numerical features (e.g., output showing correlation between 'Flow Rate (l/s)', 'Operating Hours (h)', 'Consumption (m³)', 'Number of Negative Flows').
- **Visualizations**: Various plots are generated to visualize data distributions and relationships (e.g., outputs showing matplotlib figures). These plots likely include histograms, box plots, or scatter plots for key variables.

## 5. Saving Cleaned Data

The cleaned and processed dataframes are saved to CSV files for use in subsequent analysis or modeling steps:

- `1402_clean_info.csv`: Cleaned info data for 1402.
- `1403_clean_info.csv`: Cleaned info data for 1403.
- `long_usage1402.csv`: Long format usage data for 1402.
- `long_usage1403.csv`: Long format usage data for 1403.
- `long_usage1401.csv`: Long format usage data for 1401.

This notebook provides the foundational steps for preparing the water meter data, ensuring data quality and consistency before proceeding with further analysis.
